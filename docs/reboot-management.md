#Reboot management

The **Reboot Management** functionality allows the operator to perform the following tasks:
- Retrieve last reboot time.
- Initiate immediate reboots
  - Issue command and inspect its status in the device twin.
- Schedule reboots
  - Schedule a reboot for a certain time - to be executed once, or daily - and inspect that schedule in the device twin.

## Retrieve Last Boot Time

*After* the device reboots, the `"reported.microsoft.management.rebootInfo.lastBootTime"` property is set, which is defined as follows:

<pre>
"reported" : {
    "microsoft" : {
        "management" : {
            "rebootInfo" : {
                "lastBootTime" : "<i>Datetime in ISO 8601 format, UTC</i>"
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

**Example**

Device boots and sets `"lastBootTime"` property:

```
"reported" : {
    "microsoft" : {
        "management" : {
            "rebootInfo" : {
                `"lastBootTime"` : "2017-01-25T13:34:33+04:00"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Note that this property is set after every boot, regardless of how the reboot was initiated.

## Initiate Immediate Reboot

The **Immediate Reboot** operation is initiated by the device receiving the `microsoft.management.immediateReboot` method.

### Input Payload 
Input payload is empty

### Output Payload
The device responds immediately with the following JSON payload:

<pre>
"response" : value (<i>See below</i>)
</pre>

Possible `"response"` values are: 
- `"accepted"` - The reboot request was accepted. The device will attempt to reboot momentarily (note: the attempt might fail, see below)
- `"rejected"` - The device rejected the reboot request. The device will not reboot.

The device might not be in a state that allows reboot. For example, it might be
in a middle of an important operation that cannot be disrupted. If no such
condition is detected, the device responds by accepting the request and
attempting to reboot.

Further, the device management client needs to consult the primary app running
on the device whether it is acceptable to reboot. The app responds based on its
business logic which, for interactive apps, might require user consent.

The state of the latest reboot request is communicated to the back-end via
reported properties as described in [Device Twin Communication](#device-twin-communication) below.

After the device reboots, `"reported.microsoft.management.rebootInfo.lastBootTime"` will be set to a new value.
This can be used to confirm the reboot took place.

**Examples:**

Successful response:

```
"response" : "accepted"
```

### Device Twin Communication

After responding to the method call, the device attempts to reboot. The result
of the attempt is recorded in the reported property `"reported.microsoft.management.rebootInfo.lastRebootCmdTime"`, which
is JSON object with two key/value pairs defined as follows:

<pre>
"reported" : {
    "microsoft" : {
        "management" : {
            "rebootInfo" : {
                "lastRebootCmdTime": "<i>Datetime in ISO 8601 format, UTC</i>"
                "lastRebootCmdStatus": "<i>value</i>"
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

`"lastRebootCmdTime"` is persisted on the device. It reflects the last time the device received an immediate reboot command. 

`"lastRebootCmdStatus"` possible values are: 
- `"accepted"` - The reboot request was accepted. The device will attempt to reboot momentarily.
- `"rejected"` - The device rejected the reboot request. The device will not reboot.

**Examples:**

Successful response:

```
"reported" : {
    "microsoft" : {
        "management" : {
            "rebootInfo" : {
                "lastRebootCmdTime": "2017-01-25T13:27:33+04:00"
                "lastRebootCmdStatus": "accepted"
            }
        }
    }
}
```



## Schedule Reboots

The **Schedule Reboots** operation is initiated by the device receiving the `"desired.microsoft.management.scheduledReboot"` desired property.

### Configuration Format
The format of the `"desired.microsoft.management.scheduledReboot"` desired property is as follows:

<pre>
"desired" : {
    "microsoft" : {
        "management" : {
            "scheduledReboot" :{
                "singleRebootTime" : "<i>Datetime in ISO 8601 format, UTC</i>"
                "dailyRebootTime" : "<i>Datetime in ISO 8601 format, UTC</i>"
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

Note that the full date and time are required when specifying the daily reboot time. The date will denote when the daily reboot should start taking place.

**Examples**

Perform a singleRebootTime reboot on Jan 25th, 2017 at 09:00 UTC time and also reboot daily at 3 AM:

```
"desired" : {
    "microsoft" : {
        "management" : {
            "scheduledReboot" : {
                "singleRebootTime" : "2017-01-25T09:00:00+00:00"
                "dailyRebootTime" : "2017-01-25T03:00:00+00:00"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Either or both <i>singleRebootTime</i> and <i>dailyRebootTime</i> can be set to an empty string to indicate no reboot is scheduled.

### Reporting Format

The current state of reboot configuration and status is stored under the `"reported.microsoft.management.rebootInfo"`.

<pre>
"reported" : {
    "microsoft" : {
        "management" : {
            "rebootInfo" : {
                "dailyRebootTime": "<i>Datetime in ISO 8601 format, UTC</i>",
                "singleRebootTime": "<i>Datetime in ISO 8601 format, UTC</i>"
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

**dailyRebootTime** and **singleRebootTime** reflect the values set in the desired scheduledReboot property.
